# Application Title: Logo_Mastermind

This GitHub repository contains the code for a brand recognition game that challenges users to guess the brand names while providing insights into the effects of marketing exposure. The game leverages datasets of logos, which are stored in Google Drive, and utilizes a local CSV asset for efficient file management.

# Overview
Logo Mastermind is an iOS game developed in Swift as a personal project. The game presents players with a random logo and challenges them to guess the corresponding brand name. This project explores the effects of marketing exposure by analyzing players' ability to recognize and recall various logos.

# Development Period
December 2021 - January 2022

# Features and Functionality
Random Logo Generation: The game generates random logos from a dataset of 500+ logos.
Brand Name Guessing: Players are presented with a logo and have to guess the corresponding brand name.
Local CSV Asset: The game utilizes a local CSV file for efficient file management and storage of logo datasets.
Self-Taught Swift Development: The project involved self-learning Swift to develop the iOS game.

# Dataset Generation
A dataset of logos was generated and stored in Google Drive.
The logos were sourced and curated to represent a wide range of well-known brands.

# Repository Structure
When reviewing the code, please follow these steps:

Start by exploring the Swift code files within the repository, which include the main game logic.
